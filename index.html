        <p id="food">Dosa with coconut chutney and spicy sambar is my all-time favorite food, a perfect blend of flavor and comfort. The dosa is golden, crisp on the outside yet soft inside, releasing a tempting aroma as it’s served hot. The creamy coconut chutney adds a refreshing, mild sweetness that balances the flavors beautifully. Paired with it, the spicy, tangy sambar—rich with tamarind, lentils, and fresh vegetables—brings warmth and a burst of taste in every bite. Together, they create a delightful harmony of textures and spices, making each mouthful pure joy. It’s not just food—it’s happiness served on a plate.</p>

        <p id="gym">My hobby is going to the Gym, where I train with Discipline and Consistency to improve both body and mind. Every workout is a step toward becoming stronger, healthier, and more confident. I focus on proper form, balanced routines, and pushing my limits while respecting my body’s needs. Whether it’s lifting weights, doing cardio, or stretching, I approach each session with dedication. The Discipline keeps me committed even on tough days, and the Consistency ensures steady progress over time. For me, the gym is more than exercise—it’s a lifestyle that builds strength, focus, and determination, both inside and outside the walls.</p>
